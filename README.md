## What is this about?
Its a challenge based on [this repo of ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) to create something for fun and improve your skills.

[Using this idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Quiz-App.md) [I've created a design](https://www.figma.com/file/UIZMZ506JPWYLUzdxvDHMr/Frontend-Quiz-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1) just to ilustrate better and have a guided design to focus only in the code. (feel free to use it too)
